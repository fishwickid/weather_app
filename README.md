Weather Forecast App

If you want to discover the current temperuture and even get a 5 day weather forecast, then the Weather Forecaster is a quick and easy solution. 

The user simply types her city of choice into the search bar and hits the search button. 

From there the user will see initially the current temperature of that city, including humidity, wind speed and a UV index.

Below the current temperature you can also see the 5 day forecast including the date, temperature and humidity percentage for that day. 

This whole app was created using a Bootsrtrap framework for the front end design and Jquery to create all of the interactive behaviour.
